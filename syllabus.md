The Art of Data Visualization
VCD / ATS: 3032, Tuesdays  9:00 AM - 4:00 PM, MacLean 917
Jan 28 — May 6, 2014
Alan Rhodes & Chris Baker, grhodes@saic.edu, cbaker2@saic.edu


In a studio workshop environment, an interdisciplinary co-taught team will focus on the design, development and creation of data visualization projects. Projects will be organized around conceptual areas including: Maximal & Cryptic Data (visualizing the impossible, invisible and incomprehensible), "Useful" Data (examine the idea of "useful" vs "not useful" data visualizations), Process Data (such as crowdsourcing, online collaboration and the work of artists like Aaron Koblin), Provocative Data (data and data gathering as both material and conceptual artistic content), Material Data (using data to inspire and generate abstract visual or sculptural forms), Translatable Data (translating data between medium(s) e.g. time to space, space to time, data to sound, sound to data, etc), Lonely and Hidden Data (learning what data to ignore and how to reveal hidden data). Contemporary platforms will be workshopped; these may include: Processing, D3 (http://d3js.org/), RGB+D, ManyEyes, Mondrian, ImageJ, and ImagePlot.

Students do not have to have had experience with specific coding; the course will seek to create a studio environment in which different techniques and backgrounds can be used to realize projects and, as well, teams of students with diverse skills formed.  But, that said, a basic familiarity with the coding process (Java, HTML, other) will be very advantageous.

The instructional team, Christopher Baker (ATS) and Alan Rhodes (VCD), will draw on a diversity of skills and backgrounds in technology, design, video installation, interactive media, gallery , public, and internet art. 


W1 Jan.28 ’14							Tentative Schedule
- Introductions
- Introduction to Data Epistemology 
- True vs. False Data
- Objective vs. Subjective
- Anecdotal vs. Empirical
- Data as aesthetic of Truth
- Visualization as Analog
- Self Portrait project assigned and explained

Self Portrait mini-Project—
A data set is provided, along with some basic models for representing that data.  Each student is to visualize and present the given data set to tell a story about their own lives, their ‘quantified self’.


W2 Feb.4
- In class individual project
- Output data and present it
- First half of class
- presentations
- Second half of class
- take someone else's data and make a new portrait of that person


W3 Feb.11
- Data Collection / Sampling (in class project) 
- Image Processing: How is it sampled?  What Feature is chosen?
- Students plug in data


- W4 Feb.18
- Big Data - Rewriting histories (archive)

- big data reading
- Big Data Set / Archived Data handed out
- Processing / Coding
- Big Data Project assigned

Big Data Project—
A team project; students are provided with a large data set (i.e., all Bitcoin transactions to date) and will create their own algorithms to process/visualize it in order to achieve conceptual and/or aesthetic expression.

Live Data Project—
Students will choose a live data stream (Vine, Twitter), and create a screen-based live visualization of that data.
