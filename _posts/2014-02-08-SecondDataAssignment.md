Here is an example of the second DataVis in Processing Assignment.  I have taken the Chicago.gov dataset from here, </br>https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Sex-Offenders/vc9r-bqvy
</br>
In excel, I converted the height column to inches (from feet and inches), then transposed the data isolating just the Weight, Height, and Age data (in descending order to help with the drawing).  I made slight adjustments to the Processing drawing code, so that it would change color as it goes through each row, and also added the option for PDF output.  In this linked zip file below are the original data file, the transposed one, the adjusted Processing patch, and a PDF output.

You can refer back to the original in-class project here, </br>

This is the output from the Processing DataVis example linked above, also included as a PDF in the .zip file.
