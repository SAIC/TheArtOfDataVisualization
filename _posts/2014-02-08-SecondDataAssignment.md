Here is an example of the second DataVis in Processing Assignment.  I have taken the Chicago.gov dataset from <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Sex-Offenders/vc9r-bqvy" target="_new">here.</a> </br></br>



</br></br>
In excel, I converted the height column to inches (from feet and inches), then transposed the data isolating just the Weight, Height, and Age data (in descending order to help with the drawing).  I made slight adjustments to the Processing drawing code, so that it would change color as it goes through each row, and also added the option for PDF output.  In <a href="http://saic.github.io/TheArtOfDataVisualization/people/garhodes/data/ArtDataVis_example2_sexOffender.zip" target="_new">this linked zip file</a>  are the original data file, the transposed one, the adjusted Processing patch, and a PDF output.  You can see an image of the output below.
</br></br>

Here the same project is made a little cleaner with the 'map' command in Processing. <a href="http://saic.github.io/TheArtOfDataVisualization/people/garhodes/data/ArtDataVis_example2_sexOffender_mapped.zip" target="_new">zipped here.</a> </br></br>




</br></br>

You can refer back to the original in-class project <a href="http://saic.github.io/TheArtOfDataVisualization/processing/2014/02/04/FirstDataExperiment.html" target="_new">here.</a> </br></br>

</br></br>

This is the output from the Processing DataVis example linked above, also included as a PDF in the .zip file.
