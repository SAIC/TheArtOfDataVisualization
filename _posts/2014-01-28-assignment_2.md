1. **Post a photo** (from online or from the world around you), that shows an example of 'truthiness' or 'facty-ness' or 'science-iness' ... that is, things presenting themselves as objective truth through their aesthetics.

   Use Chris' example post, CatBall, to figure out how to post an image and give it a caption... use the reading below to inform the idea of captions ...

2. **Read the short essay** shared with you on Google Drive -- _Roland Barthes, The Plates of the Encyclopedia_.  What we are looking for are conceptual parallels between photography (a factual analogue medium) and DataVis.
