**Due for class Week3 - Feb. 11**

</br></br>
1. **Post a photo** (from online or from the world around you), that shows an example of 'truthiness' or 'facty-ness' or 'science-iness' ... that is, things presenting themselves as objective truth through their aesthetics.

   </br>Use Chris' example post, CatBall, to figure out how to post an image and give it a caption... use the reading below to inform the idea of captions ...

2. **Read the short essay** shared with you on Google Drive -- _Roland Barthes, The Plates of the Encyclopedia_.  What we are looking for are conceptual parallels between photography (a factual analogue medium) and DataVis.

3. **Put new data into the Processing Patch** using the Processing patch made in class, find some original (hopefully interesting) data to process with that algorithm, or an adjusted version of it.  Bring the output, the processing project, and the original data to class for workshopping.
</br>
The Processing demo from class and all its files can be downloaded here, </br></br>[first data experiment] (http://saic.github.io/TheArtOfDataVisualization/processing/2014/02/04/FirstDataExperiment.html)

</br></br>

A post giving an example of plugging in new data to the patch can be seen here,</br></br>
