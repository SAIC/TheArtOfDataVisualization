**Second Term Project - Due for In-Process Critique April 14 and Final Critique May 14**

</br></br>
**1  The arena** 'Live DataVis' is not a delineated area, instead we use the term to refer to a type of experience-- see [notes of Live DataVis] (http://saic.github.io/TheArtOfDataVisualization/post/2014/03/18/LiveDataVis_notes.html).  So we are looking for more of an argument in the proposal stage as to why this project idea is 'live'-- as discussed in class, we are thinking especially of simultaneous data feeds or the incorporation of analogues, but, please, surprise us.  
</br></br>
**2  But, to locate it a little, here are some examples:** 
</br></br>
**Ex.1 - an ongoing visualization** one possibility is to use data sources that are ongoing such as tweets, or vines, or wind data, or temperature, or other online or not online sources that continue to change.  The project would then create a visualization of this dataset that continues to translate or aggregate as time goes on.  Like live mapping projects (Wind Map, twitter maps), or live translation projects (like twittAR or spotcrime on Layar, or any O-Meter project), or live aggregation projects (like http://www.usdebtclock.org/  which uses live data to calculate a running total).  Typically these would be electronic publications, but physical analogues or built devices are also possible.
</br></br>
**Ex.2 - documentation of the live** another possibility is a moving image documentation of a 'once-live' dataset (this would be like Aaron Koblin's Visualizing Amsterdam SMS Messages, or Flight Patterns).  Normally, this would involve building a device, and then running and recording it... similar to our Divvy Bike data playback.  In the case of these types of projects, you'll need to convince us that it is 'live enough'.
</br></br>
**Ex.3 - live access** this is a slippery area, but I would think much of the rest of Aaron Koblin's work would fit in this category, in which a tool is built, and then people's interaction with it creates the visualization, like The Sheep Market.
</br></br></br></br>


**Groups** This final project is open to self-determined groups or individual works.  We will try to facilitate in class the possibilities of collaboration regardless.
