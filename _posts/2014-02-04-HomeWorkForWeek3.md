###For next week

</br></br>**Post a photo** (from online or from the world around you), that shows an example of 'truthiness' or 'facty-ness' or 'science-iness' ... that is, things presenting themselves as objective truth through their aesthetics.</br></br> Use Chris' example post, 'CatBall', to figure out how to post an image and give it a caption... use the reading below to inform the idea of captions..</br></br></br>

**Read the short essay** shared with you on Google Drive-- Roland Barthes, The Plates of the Encyclopedia.  What we are looking for are conceptual parallels between photography (a factual analogue medium) and DataVis.</br></br></br>
