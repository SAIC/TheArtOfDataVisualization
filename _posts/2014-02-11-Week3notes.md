Art of Data Visualization - W3</br></br>
Notes on Barthes' The Plates of the Encyclopedia
</br></br></br></br>
"History, like pornography, begins with the photograph.  Everything before was just someone's panting prose." </br></br>--Hollis Frampton

</br></br></br></br>

In these notes I will play a game with this essay from 50 years ago, replacing 'encyclopedia' with data visualization wherever I can.

</br></br></br></br>
Barthes begins with the **Object**, and I think of DataVisualizations as making things into Objects, something which
</br></br>
* "produces at once an inventory and a definition," separating image from text into an 'autonomous iconography'.
</br></br>
I wonder, can Data Visualization, too, be 'apprehended' on three levels:
</br></br>
* the **'anthological'**, 'isolated from any context.. presented in itself'
</br>
* the **'anecdotic'**, 'naturalized by its insertion into a .... vignette',
</br>
* and the **'genetic'**, 'when the image offers us the trajectory from raw substance to finished object' (which sounds to me like process or algorithm... 'sometimes it IS, sometimes it is MADE, sometimes it even MAKES').
</br></br>
Barthes talking about the encyclopedia's fascination with wood--even wooden machines-- reminds me of Vilem Flusser talking about the etymology of 'technology', (hyle, Greek for wood), and the idea of carving forms from the raw natural material.  
</br></br></br>
It is interesting that what he says about the photos of the encyclopedia, that the photos always include a human, is exactly what's repressed in DataVis-- you never see a human.  But there's a similarity to the aesthetics of the photos, 
</br></br>
"an aesthetic of bareness: huge, empty, well-lighted rooms... the simple, here, is nothing but the vital."  I wonder if we can find an analogue to the narrative process Barthes finds in the photos, from minimalist, to crowded signifying the process from "production to consumption"-- in the machine era, the movement from factory to shop.
</br></br>
Let's replace 'encyclopedia' with 'data visualization': "Formally [in Data Visualization], ownership depends on a certain dividing up of things: to appropriate is to fragment the world, to divide it into finite objects subject to man in proportion to their very discontinuity: for we cannot separate without finally naming and classifying, and at that moment, property is born."
</br></br>
And again...  "[In Data Visualization] the object has been endowed with an unfortunate opacity; assimilated to an inhuman state of nature, its proliferation cannot be noted without a sentiment of apocalypse or of alienation: the modern object is either asphyxiation or nausea."
</br></br>
So if humans were always pictured in documenting the machine age, are machines always pictures when we now document the information age?
</br></br></br></br>

Finally, can we derive a similar **"Poetics of Data Visualization"?** ...defining 'poetics' as "the spere of the infinite vibrations of meaning, at the center of which is placed the literal object."  Poetry as "disproportion" (macroscopic, microscopic), and "immobility."
</br></br>

" [Data Visualization] constantly proceeds to an impious fragmentation of the world, but what it finds at the term of this fracture is not the fundamental state of pur causes; in most cases the image obliges it to recompose an object that is strictly UNREASONABLE; once the first nature is dissolved, another nature appears, quite as formed as the first.  In a word, the fracture of the world is impossible: a glance suffices—ours—for the world to be eternally complete."
