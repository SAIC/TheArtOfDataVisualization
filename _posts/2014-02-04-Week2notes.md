Discuss critique terms w/ some reference to reading</br>
Present projects</br>
</br></br>
LUNCH</br>
</br></br>
Discuss and workshop the course schedule from syllabus</br>
GitHub markup (prep tfor picture posting)</br>
Make some groups of 2 or 3 to do in-class processing project (making a portrait from another's data)
</br></br>
Given time, or for next week— students discuss reading questions/notes in groups.
</br></br>
--for next week?  not sure.... continuation of that in-class project?--- groups of 2 or 3.
</br></br>
To post on GitHub: students to post pictures of ‘truthiness’ in data vis around them.

Notes, Observations, Terms, and Questions from Flusser, ‘On Memory’</br></br>

Memory: a broad definition as all that which is preserved (in nature, in DNA, in physics & thermodynamics) and in opposition to,
</br>
Entropy: the dis-integrating force… I wonder what Flusser thinks of Entropy, he doesn’t say… is it the ultimate Good?  Or Bad?
</br>
History: is then the (non-existent but desired) uninterrupted chain of information, which can not be achieved through Noisy oral communication or noisy evolution and nature.
</br>
Material culture: human’s first attempt to preserve information—like a knife preserves the information of ‘how to cut’… “magical thinking,” like,
</br>
Monuments: objects that serve exclusively as memory supports, solved the problem of,
</br>
Waste: which is just ‘disinformed objects’, this was followed by noisy,
</br>
Oral culture: which brings about and “mythical thinking,” and 
</br>
Written culture: which brings and linear causal thinking.
</br>
Written language: brought it’s own new religion, a
</br>
Platonic library: a library of superhuman memory to be served— ‘To know is to remember’— a philosophy in opposition to the,
</br>
Talmudic: relativistic, dialectic, discourse-driven ‘transhuman memory’ that seeks truth in the Other.  All this is a discussion of,
</br>
Epistemology: the study of how we know and understand Truth, and,
</br>
Ontology: the study of how we know and understand Being.
</br>
“Information in the Age of Electronic Memory”: provides humans with a ‘critical distance’ from their own information storage [so they can see the true Truth]; we no longer have to remember our memories and can instead engage in,
</br>
“Processing of information”: which is ‘creativity’, become Programmers (of information) instead of Workers (of materials), and finally see that,
</br>
“Memory is not a thing but a process”: that makes Art into Science and vice-versa, and resolves the dichotomy of ‘Objective Knowledge’ and ‘Subjective Experience’ [though I am not totally sure how].

</br></br></br>

Questions:</br></br>

If written language brought about linear causal thinking (and material, magical thinking, and oral mythical thinking), what is DataVis thinking?</br></br>

As is his nature, Flusser overshoots and leaves us a little hanging… how does ‘information in the age of electronic memory’ make Art into Science and vice versa?</br></br>
