We will be using [Processing][1] to develop prototypes and learn programming concepts.  There are lots of resources for learning [Processing][1].  Here are a few:

### Beginner
- [Hello Processing][2], by Dan Shiffman
    - This interactive video is an absolutely essential crash course for [Processing][1].
- [Introduction to Programming][5], by Kahn Academy
    - These tutorials use [Processing][1] as a teaching / example tool, so the skills are easily transferable to our setup.       

### Intermediate
- [The Nature of Code][3], by Dan Shiffman
    - An essential resource for artists interested in creating "natural" effects in [Processing][1].
-  [Processing Tutorials][4]
    - The standard [Processing][1] tutorials.
-  [Processing Examples][5]
    - The standard [Processing][1] examples.  Exploring examples is a great way to learn once you understand the basics.
