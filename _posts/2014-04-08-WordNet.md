<b>Notes on Rita and WordNet - parsing text in Processing</b>
</br></br>
In class today, Chris demoed where to find sample processing code for parsing text.  You need to download, unzip, and install two Processing libraries, RITa and RITaWN, they are here-- note in the first link, it seems like the current download throws errors sometimes, but it doesn't if you download the archived 'alpha' version instead.

</br></br>
and Wordnet is here marked [download]
</br></br>
http://www.rednoise.org/rita/wordnet/documentation/docs.htm
</br></br>

These need to be unzipped and placed in the Processing library folder /Documents/Processing/Library/
</br></br>
Then when Processing is relaunched you can go to File => Examples => Contributed Libraries  and there are examples there.  Documentation can be found here,
