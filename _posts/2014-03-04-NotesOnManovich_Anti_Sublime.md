To set the stage we should note two things: Manovich is writing this in 2002, and he contradicts himself, or he is wrong, and he probably knows it and is being provocative.
</br></br></br></br>
Some notes as we go through:</br></br></br></br>
The first footnote brings up the subject of what is now called 'software studies'-- the discourse around how GUIs of creative software effect the paradigms of that creativity (I heard Claudia Hart give a nice presentation on 3D animation software and how it is based on an ontology of western Cartesian geometry)... this is really a continuation of a discussion begun around the camera and avant-garde rejection of the perspectival tradition (i.e. Brakhage).
</br></br></br></br>
Manovich raises this same question for data visualization: "the new politics of mapping."  "Who has the power to decide what kind of mapping to use..."  So what about that within our own discussion of DataVis: who decides how, and how does the how, of representation control the message?
</br></br></br></br>
Manovich tries to coin a term, 'meta-media', which might be useful to us: data visualizations that act as translations of other media, "A meta-media object contains both language and meta-language- both the original media structure (a film, an architectural space, a sound track) and the software tools that allow the user to generate descriptions of this structure to change this structure."  So how much does this only apply to software, or DataVis at large?  Is software DataVis?  (i.e., if computers are largely used as "simulation machines for old media," could all these 'simulation engine' practices be called DataVis)
</br></br></br></br>
It is here that we start to reach the contradictions, when Manovich talks about the anti-sublime.  For our own reference, Wikipedia defines 'sublime': "In aesthetics, the sublime (from the Latin sublÄ«mis) is the quality of greatness, whether physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual or artistic. The term especially refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement or imitation."
</br></br></br></br>
So when Manovich describes the act, in Carnivore, of transforming "the informational chaos of data packets moving through the network into clear and orderly forms," isn't this an expression of trying to massage objects into a sublime, not 'anti-sublime' like he states?  A little farther down he describes Carnivore as taking an "invisible and 'messy' phenomena" and making it something "ordered and geometric"-- is this not Romantic?
</br></br></br></br>
He says that the promise of mapping the invisible in DataVis "makes data mapping into the exact opposite of the Romantic art concerned with the sublime."  We guess he says this because making things visible might mean quantifying things, 'bringning them down to earth and human level'-- so do we see this in DataVis over the last 12 years since this article?  What about New Aesthetics and the neo-baroque?
</br></br></br></br>
His critique of some DataVis art not having 'motivation' behind the technique of mapping is useful for us.  He calls this the 'dark side' of computer media, "its built-in existential angst."  How can our DataVis techniques be 'motivated'?
</br></br></br></br>
He offers a few possibilities: a surrealist, self-reflexive, 'arbitrary' technique ('irrational'), like a derive based on a map of London... Where do we see this-- how do we do this?
</br></br></br></br>
14 years later, what other ways can we see to motivate technique... to dig into this question, "how to represent the personal subjective experience of a person living in a data society"?  What "new ways" have we found or can we invent?
