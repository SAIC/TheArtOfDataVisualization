We will be using [Markdown][1] to develop to post on our blog, make pages, etc.  Markdown is not a replacement for HTML tags (e.g. `<em>Hi</em>` vs. `_Hi_`, both > _Hi_), but a "publishing" language useful for writing.  One of the main advantages is that it is readable in both plain text and formatted text, which can be especially nice when coding.  While there are several flavors of Markdown (various groups have extended its capabilities to suit their needs), we are using _Github Flavored Markdown_.

Here are key resources to learn [Markdown][1]:
