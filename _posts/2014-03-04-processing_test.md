This is a processing test.

Please take a look at [this post](https://raw.github.com/SAIC/TheArtOfDataVisualization/gh-pages/_posts/2014-03-04-processing_test.md) for a simple way to post your Processing sketches.

I placed my sketch in the `people/bakercp` folder and linked it from there using the header (see the top of the raw doc).  That will automatically cause it to show up.
