This processing test takes the `.pde` from [the example](http://saic.github.io/TheArtOfDataVisualization/post/2014/02/08/SecondDataAssignment.html) and applies it to a different [dataset]({{site.baseurl}}/people/amonks/data/caveins-vs-graffiti.tsv): the average time (in days) taken to fix potholes vs the average time (in days) taken to fix graffiti in Chicago between 4/4/11 and 7/15/12. The longer set of bars represent graffiti.
