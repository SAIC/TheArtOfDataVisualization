Using data taken from [the World Data Bank](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx)

Attempt to visualize population vs. % population with access to electricity.

Note: some countries have 0 electricity data, and something is currently "falling apart" at the end (Zimbabwe and United States should *not* have same radii)

here is a screenshot ![screenshot](/TheArtOfDataVisualization/people/manzalena/electricityAccess/electricity.png)
