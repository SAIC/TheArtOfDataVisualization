#idea

- dataset - sex offender list
	
	we may can use those columns : 
	
	block(geolocation), race, date of birth(zodiac)..
	
	
	- detail
	
		in block column, if there are many rows that have same st name -> normalize it
			
			e.g) many of 060XX S.ABC st -> 06000 S.ABC st, 06010 S.ABC st, 06020...

I think we need better data set for either sexoffenders or pot holes.

thoese two data sets doesn't get along each other... :(

I'm thinking about chicagoan's average income or broken window report kinda stuff to correspond with the sexoffender one.

or do you have any better idea?

let me know, I will keep looking for interesting data sets.
